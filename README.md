Meet GLaDOS, my advanced voice assistant inspired by the iconic character from the game Portal.

It uses a text-to-speech module that faithfully reproduces the original voice from the game. GLaDOS is connected to my Home Assistant server via API,
allowing me to control all devices in my home through voice commands. It is activated using a wake word and features an animation that responds to voice input.
Additionally, GLaDOS is known for its unique sense of humor and is quite adept at delivering subtle (and not-so-subtle) insults, just like in the game!
For example, when I asked it for a cake recipe, GLaDOS replied, "Sure, but remember, in this house, the cake is always a lie."
